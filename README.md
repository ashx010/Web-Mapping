# Web-Mapping
Our project aims to develop a web-based interactive mapping application utilizing Leaflet, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The application will provide users with a seamless experience for exploring and interacting with geographical data.

# Key Features:

* Interactive Maps: Utilizing Leaflet's capabilities, users can navigate and zoom in/out on maps, toggle layers, and interact with markers.
* Data Visualization: The application will visualize geographical data, such as points of interest or geographic features, using markers, polygons, and overlays.
* Customization: Users can customize map styles, markers, and overlays to suit their preferences or specific use cases.
* Search Functionality: Implementing search functionality using PHP, users can search for specific locations or points of interest within the map interface.
* User Authentication: Optionally, the application can include user authentication using PHP to provide access control and personalized experiences.
